This library allows you to interact with the customers, tickets, inventory, and locations objects without needing to do the hard work of binding your calls and data to endpoints. Simply call an action such as `Customer.create` and pass some data and let the library do the rest.

## Install

```bash
npm install tuneuptechnology
```

## Example

```javascript
const tuneuptechnology = require('tuneuptechnology');

const client = new tuneuptechnology.client(process.env.API_EMAIL, process.env.API_KEY);

const data = {
  firstname: 'Jake',
  lastname: 'Peralta',
  email: 'jake@example.com',
  phone: '8015551234',
  user_id: 1,
  notes: 'Believes he is a good detective.',
  location_id: 1,
};

client.customers.create(data).then(console.log).catch(console.log);
```

Other examples can be found in the `/examples` directory. Alter according to your needs.
